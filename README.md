Phenotypic plasticity is the production of multiple phenotypes from a single genome and is notably observed in social insects. Multiple epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with social insect plasticity, with methylation being explored to the greatest extent. Methylation is known to play a role in caste determination in <i>Apis mellifera</i>, and other social insects, but there is limited knowledge on it's role in other bee species. In this study we analysed whole genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq data sets from head tissue of reproductive and sterile castes of the eusocial bumblebee <i>Bombus terrestris</i>.

## Project Team: 

This project is part of the work from the Social Epigenetics group at the Unviersity of Leicester, headed by Dr. Eamonn Mallon, [see website](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/selab). Data was generated by Hollie Marshall and Dr. Zoe Lonsdale. Hollie Marshall carried out all analyses.
